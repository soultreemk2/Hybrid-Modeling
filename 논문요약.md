1. 기존 머신러닝 모델 단일 사용의 한계

1) Direct calculation of THK can cause stability problems  model output directly affects the process  
When abnormal variable outside the learning range is given as input  

2) 고전적인 모델(ex. Arreinius Form) 로는 Y변수에 영향을 미치는 모든 factor를 고려할 수 없음  
Using only the traditional methods caused a huge gap between the calculated force and the actual force, because all the relevant factors in the real environment cannot be considered.  


2. 해결 방안
 
1) Inverse calculation of the classical mechanical model of hot rolling and set it as the model output value  
2) 
3) preprocessed the collected process history data and added artificial features to the model input by creating physical variables used in the classical models (physical models)   

=> create additional features from the main components of the above models, and use them to train our model
